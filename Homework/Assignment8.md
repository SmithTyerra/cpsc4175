1. Given that the book notes that "the Unified Process should be viewed as an adaptable methodology", 
I would approach the content in this chapter that seems to present the Unified process as a specific 
series of steps as guidelines to follow that may change depending on where you get your information from. 
I would take the general information presented by each step and would not try to memorize the steps 
verbatim. If it was presented as simply a methodology instead of as a process, I would approach the 
chapter as an approach to doing something rather than as set series of steps in order to get a 
specific outcome.  

2. I think that the statement from the book is, in fact, a true statement. This statement is similiar 
to our class discussion of a spiral approach to software engineering in that in order to get the final 
product, you must design, implement, and test smaller portions at a time and eventually you begin to 
combine those smaller portions in order to create the larger, final product. I feel as though these two 
statements are almost identical in regards to the approach only they are worded differently.  

3. The five core workflows are as follows:  
	1. Requirements: The aim of the requirements workflow is foe the development organization to determine 
	the client's needs.  
	2. Analysis: The aim of the analysis workflow is to analyze and refine the requirements to achieve the 
	detailed understanding of the requirements essential for developing a software product correctly and 
	maintaining easily.  
	3. Design: The aim of the design workflow is to refine the artifacts fo the analysis workflow until the 
	material is in a form that can be implemented by the programmers.  
	4. Implementation: The aim of the implementation workflow is to implement the targer software product 
	in the chosen implementation language(s).  
	5. Test: The aim of the testing workflow is to test each portion of the product to ensure that each 
	work as they are expected to independently, as well as altogether.  
	
4. The software project management plan is a document that encapsulates the goals of the project, the scope 
of the project, the budget of the project, and other things of that nature. The software development process 
encapsulates how one plans to go about designing and implementing the actual product. I do not think that a 
software project management plan could replace an explicit software development process because one document 
is about the management of a project while the other is about the development of the project. I do think that 
the software development process could be taken into consideration when creating the software project management 
plan because I think it would improve the plan's accuracy and make the estimates closer to the actual figures.  

5. I was unable to find any differences or discrepencies between the testing described in Section 3.7 and the 
testing of the artifacts produced in each of the five process areas. THe testing is described as not being a 
single and separate process or workflow but as being an ongoing process that is incorporated into each of the 
workflows. No workflow is complete without testing.  

6. Postdelivery maintenance can fit into an iterative, spiral development model by incorporating it at the very 
end of the production cycle. I would deliver the unofficial finished product to a group of people to use for a 
set amount of time (i.e. 1-3 weeks) so that unforseen bugs and errors can be detected before the product is actually 
delivered to the client.  

7. I do not feel as if these two approaches are mutually exclusive because I feel like the to approaches are one in 
the same only the Unified Process is more detailed and specific. In fact, the two are mutually supportive in that they 
essentially have the same idea and concept except the inner steps of the Unified Process are not explicit in the other model.  

8. I think the two models would be fundamentally different and I do not think either of the two models are applicable in real-
life projects. With real-life projects, unexpected situations are encountered and with that, and timelines are then changed and 
thrown off track.  

9. Software improvement is the bettering of the product while software process improvement is the bettering of the process of 
developing the product. I think that software product improvement is very important in software engineering because efficiency 
will be increased and that is a big deal when developing software.
