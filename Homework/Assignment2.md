1. The first step in creating a piece of software is _to determine what the 
client needs and creating an initial list of requirements to fit those needs._  
2. What the client needs is different from what the software should do because 
_though the client can express his/her needs, there may be a factor other than 
the software that is causing the initial problem and therefore the change 
needed would not effect the software. In other words, what the client needs is 
not always what the software should do because the software may not be the 
problem in the first place._  
3. A software engineer is a generalist rather than a specialist because 
_in order to build and create software for a living, a software engineer must 
be familiar with the different tools and implementation methods and must decide 
which set is the better option for a given situation. A specialist would only deal 
with one tool or implementation method and may not be able to effieciently solve 
the given problem being that the known tool or method may not be the best option._  
4. Techniques for determining requirements and why they may not be effective:  
* _interviewing: Interviewing may not be the best technique simply because for 
many, interviews ignites a nervous feeling. As a result, the interviewee may not 
give an accurate response to the question he/she is asked. This could make the 
processs longer as the interviewer may not be able to get an idea of where the 
actual problem lies within the system._
* _questionnaire: This technique may also not give an accurate description of 
where the problem lies because some people are afraid of what others may think of 
their answers and don't want to be the 'bearer of bad news'. As a result, they may 
'sugarcoat' the issue at hand instead of revealing the truth._ 
* _examination of forms: This technique may not be best if the company did not 
take the time to place specific details into their user manual or their 
inventory/housekeeping documents because the forms will no longer shed light on the 
way the company conducts business nor the current flow of business._
* _direct observation: This technique may not be as valuable because employees 
tend to do things differently and more 'by-the-book' if/when they know that they 
are under supervision._
5. Requirements are dynamic rather than static in the sense that _the initial 
requirements may be changed after a few iterations of the requirements workflow. 
Not only will the requirements change but so will the mindset and thought process 
of the developers overtime. As new viewpoints are dicovered, requirements are 
likely to change._  
6. _Functional requirements should be fulfilled by the software and describes 
what the software should do while nonfunctional requirements are characteristics 
of the software. I think there is a such thing as a nonfunctional requirement 
for example, if the software must be programmed in a certain language or must be 
a certain size, those are not requirements that have to do with the 'function' of 
the software._  
7. Top-down analysis is _displayed by starting with a large generalized 
component and then breaking that component down into smaller specialized 
components. In the case study in Chapter 11, they chose a different approach 
known as bottom-up analysis, which begins with the smaller components and 
building up to the larger component or solution._  
8. Many software engineers may think that prototyping is harmful because _in a way 
a prototype may give the client a false representation of what the software 
will look like and how the software will behave. In actuality, once all of the 
troubleshooting and testing is done, the software may be totally different. This 
can cause frustration amongst the client which is something that should be avoided._  
9. Team Two is doing a better job because _it is very unlikely that the initial 
requirements specification will be the final one. Lack of chanes to the requirements 
specification shows that the team is not performing iteration in order to fine-
tune the software. In a sense, Team-One is doing a 'quick job' while Team Two is 
planning, testing, and revising the software as they encounter problems and things 
that they can do better and be sure to please their client._  
10. I think that more software defects are traceable to bad requirements analysis 
than any other source because _not all software engineers take the time to make 
sure that the requirements are specificc and feasible before attempting to produce 
a product for a client. Software engineering and design takes time in order to be 
properly developed and not all software engineers are willing to put forth the 
time and effort needed in order to complete the task effectively._
