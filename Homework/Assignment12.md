1. Classes are blueprints of an object which includes variables and things that the 
objects will have (i.e. Class Student may have firstName, lastName, grade, GPA, etc.) 
while aspects are behaviors that are applicable multiple objects (i.e. monitoring/logging 
courses). If you used classes as in OOD, you would have to add a monitoring/logging method 
to each course but by using AOP you would make monitoring/logging an aspect and implement 
it at each pointcut or place in the code that aspect's code would run.

3. The approach of the Universal Windows Platform is to target all APIs that are guaranteed to 
be present on the multiple devices that you plan to use the device on (desktop, mobile, etc.). 
That set of APIs is referred to as the Universal Device Family APIs. Additionally, device family 
specific APIs are also implemented. Altogether, these API's make up the Universal Windows Platform. 
You can target the universal set of APIs and still ue the additional set of APIs by adding a SDK 
reference. Once the reference has been added, you can use the API information class to so that the 
extension API is only called if the app is running on the devices that have it or you can target a 
specific device family and in this case you would not need an extension.

5. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing 
resources via internet. Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service in which a third-party 
provider delivers hardware and software tools to the users via internet. Software as a service (SaaS) is 
a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available 
to customers via internet. Some of the similarities between the three are that all of them protect your 
API keys and are all forms of cloud computing.
