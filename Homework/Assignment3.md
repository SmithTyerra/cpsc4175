1. A software requirements specification must be _clear and intelligible to the

that are to be performed on this numerical data (i.e. 
multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)._  

3. _A data flow diagram shows the flow of data throughout a given process 
beginning with the input and ending with the output._  

4. _A finite state machine is a diagram that shows a sequence in which the output 
is a function of the inputs._  

5. _An entity-relation diagram is a diagram that show the relationship between 
entities and shows the attributes of each entity._  

6. _A structured analysis and design technique diagram is a diagram that shows 
the entities and the actions that can be performed in a given system and the 
relationship between the two._  

7. _A specification and design language diagram is a diagram that shows the 
processes of a given system and how to go from start to finish within that system._  

8. _Z specification is used to model computing systems. The function that I have
