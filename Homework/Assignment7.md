1. **Testing should** _occur throughout the entire software construction process. As stated in the book,_
> _"During the requirements workflow, the requirements must be checked; during the analysis workﬂow, the_ 
> _speciﬁcations must be checked; and the software production management plan must undergo similar scrutiny._ 
> _The design workﬂ ow requires meticulous checking at every stage. During the implementation workﬂow, each_ 
> _code artifact certainly must be tested; and the product as a whole needs testing when it has been fully integrated._ 
> _After passing the acceptance test, the product is installed and postdelivery maintenance begins. And hand in hand with_ 
> _maintenance goes repeated checking of modiﬁ ed versions of the product."_  
_I agree with the authors because I believe that in order to create software that is efficient and nearly error-free,_ 
_testing must be implemented within each stage of the software engineering process._  

2. **Veriﬁcation refers to** _the process of determining whether a workﬂow has been correctly carried out; this takes place_ 
_at the end of each workﬂow. Validation is the intensive evaluation process that takes place just before the product is_ 
_delivered to the client. Its purpose is to determine whether the product as a whole satisﬁes its speciﬁcations._ 
**Verification and validation are similiar in that** _both processes are used as a form of checking a product/software and also_ 
_as a form of testing a product/software._  

3. **Non-execution-based testing is** _generally the form of testing used in stages of the software engineering process that do not_ 
_involve executable code (i.e. requirements and anaylysis; design). This testing occurs without runnning test cases._ **Execution-based testing is** 
_the form of testing used to test executable code that is usually generated in the implementation stage of the software engineering process._   

4. **Quality, as used in the phrase _software quality assurance_** _is the concept that the product is efficiently implemented, produces the correct_ 
_and expected output, and satifies all of the client's requirements. Quality is measure in efficiency, productivity, accuracy, and satisfation._  

5. **Software should not be tested by implementors and not implemented by testers because** _testers and implementers place importance on different_ 
_aspects of the software. Testers place importance on whether or not the code produces the correct output and essentially whether the product works or not._ 
_Implementors are more concerned about how the problem is solved and whether or not the solution to the problem has been implemented in the best and most effiecient way._ 
_A tester may see no problem with the implementation of the solution while an implemtor may still find something wrong with the product even if the output is correct._  

6. **A correctness proof is** _a mathematical technique for showing that a product is correct, in other words, that it satisﬁes its speciﬁcations._ **Execution-based testing is** 
_used to ensure that the code that has been implemented produces the expected outputs and is functioning as expected. I don't necessarily think that either of the two is "better"_ 
_than the other. Instead, I think that a combination of the two is the best option because the issues that are covered by each of the two are equally important to the quality and_ 
_performance of the product/software._  

7. _This article made me think about how much people in the world today rely on software and the accuracy and efficiency of it. Being that I plan to become a computer programmer in_ 
_the future, I realize just how important my 'code' may be, depending on the company that I work for. The 911 scenario made me imagine myself being behind that software and what I_ 
_would feel like if my software came down to being the determinant in a life or death situation. I would never want my software to fail in any situation but definitely not in a life_ 
_or death one. I knew that software has become the go to in today's society and that many people rely on it but this article really brought me to realization. Words to the wise: Don't_ 
_attempt to create any software if you are not serious about it and are not willing to properly test and implement it._  

8. _I highly doubt that there will be a "Software Apocalypse". I would like to think that there will not be one since this would affect my future career tremendously. I will devote myself_ 
_to my career in hopes that by creating efficient, accurate, and beneficial products, mself, along with others in the field will be able to prevent the Software Apocalypse that the author_ 
_speaks of. As long as we have this mindset and also have the scare of a possible Software Apocalypse in mind as we pursue ou careers and produce software, the Software Apocalypse should_ 
_be null, void, and non-existent._
